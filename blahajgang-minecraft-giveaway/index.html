This would be a voxel model that depicts some art for the awesome 1Hive ecosystem. (*I know, this should be on crypto-voxel, but I don't have a Parcel there.. If you'd like to collaborate over a crypto-voxel collection and share a parcel.. or something, dm me on discord). These are 'unofficial' and are minted by Vyvy-vi#5040. 
I'll mint the NFTs at around 1 PM CET on 2nd September, 2021. If you're filling the form after that.. RIP :/
Also, this isn't a cash-grab, and I'll only mint as many NFTs as the responses to this form + 1 for me.. though I do have some royalties set if anyone's selling their airdrop ;) " />
